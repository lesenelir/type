# Type 

Creating a typing animation in React using different libraries and custom approaches.

Successfully replicated the animation effect from OpenAI's official website.

## Typewriter Libraries

- [react-typing-animation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-type-animation)

- [typewriter-effect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typewriter-effect)

## Custom Approach

- setTimeout

- requestAnimationFrame

## OpenAI Demo

To see the animation effect from OpenAI's official website, go to [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt).

I've rebuilt the website using React, incorporating the `typewriter-effect` and `tailwindcss` libraries.
